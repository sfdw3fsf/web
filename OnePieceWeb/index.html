                <h1>Climate</h1>
                <p>The weather is unusual on the Grand Line to say the least, the standard rules of meteorology donâ€™t apply. 
                    The ocean currents and weather patterns are extremely volatile and inconsistent, they can drastically change in an instant; 
                    this includes water spouts, storms, blizzards, heat waves, thick fog, and many other such things.[13] 
                    There are also cyclones that seem to appear quickly and suddenly, they are remarked as being impossible to predict.[14]</p>

            <div class="column column2">
                <h1>OverView</h1>
                <p>The Grand Line is the gigantic sea route that circles around the planet, stretching <br/>from west to east.[4] It follows a
                    n imaginary line that runs from north-west to south-east across the middle of the world <br/>and perpendicular to the Red Line, a vast 
                    ring-like continent that circles 
                    the globe from north-east to south-west.[5][6] The Grand Line is placed similarly to the equator. In fact, the main 
                    importance of the Grand Line is that it is the only way to circumnavigate the globe.[5]<br/>

                   The Grand Line and the Red Line crossing each other is what divides the rest of the Blue Sea into four oceans[7]: the N
                   orth Blue, the East Blue, the West Blue, and the South Blue.[7] As such, they are key to worldwide<br/> trade and travel in that the 
                   Lines are placed along the paths between the Blues. This makes them valuable routes of travel and obstacles for both pirates and civilians
                    alike.[citation needed]</p>

            <div class="column column3">
                <h1>Navigation</h1>
                <p>A normal compass wont work on the Grand Line due to each island generating its own magnetic field. In order to navigate the Grand Line, one needs a special type of compass known as a Log Pose.

                    The Log Pose works by locking on to the magnetism produced by one island and points toward that island. 
                    After reaching said island and staying there for a certain amount of time,
                    the Log Pose will reset and start locking on to the magnetism of the next island. The time it takes for a Log Pose to set i
                    s different on each island;
                     it may take a few hours, it may take a few days, or even a full year.[16][17]</p>
